# Inventory-and-Billing-System-DBMS-
Inventory management and billing system for a sweet's shop.

## Features
1. Used *mysql API* for database connection in *python*
2. Used *flask* for backend processing in *python*
3. Used *HTML* and *CSS* for frontend

The main purpose of the project is to understand the working of database systems in web applications. For this a separate library *CmsLib* has been implemented, which provides the methods required to access the required database. It modularizes the different components of the inventory and billing management system and organizes the actions related to those components separately.
